# Snake and Ladder Game in Java

## Introduction
This is a simple **Snake and Ladder** game implemented in Java for two players. The game follows the classic rules where players roll a dice to advance their positions on the board. If a player lands on a ladder, they climb up, and if they land on a snake, they slide down. The first player to reach **100** wins!

## How to Play
1. Run the program in a Java-supported environment.
2. Enter the names of both players when prompted.
3. Players take turns rolling the dice by pressing **Enter**.
4. The dice roll determines how many steps a player moves forward.
5. Landing on a **ladder** moves the player **up**.
6. Landing on a **snake** moves the player **down**.
7. The first player to reach **100** wins the game!

## Features
- Two-player turn-based gameplay.
